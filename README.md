## Cover Letter

Thank you BoonmeeLab for considering my application and sented my this test.
The test is very fun to work with.

While I was taking this test, I timer myself.
It took me almost 3 hours to finish the BarChart component alone without styling following requirements.
After I made BarChart to work, I quickly did styling and finish the test within 3 hours and 20 minutes.
Therefore, this is my timeline of doing this test.

### Timeline
- 3 hours -> Website can show every contents and responsive
- 3 hours and 20 minutes -> Website finished 


What I think I missed is that the graph is not update min and max value when the selected year is change.
This can be fix easily but the time was already out.
So if you would like me to fix this, pls let me know.
Git commit will have only one commit since I have limited time.
If I have more time, I would prefer commit each update.
I think that it's my mistake that I chose to use TS to make project more contributable but it turns out that it took many of my time dealing with type and some of them still have some error.


## Dev
To run the project, you can following structure below.

```sh
yarn add

yarn dev
```


## Stack
Since the test want me to use as less as library as possible, this is stack I use to finish this test.
- Vite + React: Frontend framework
